## Projects  

### Property Tycoon  
**Independent Game Development Project**  

A Python-based virtual property trading game inspired by classic board-game economics. Players compete to purchase, trade, and develop properties while managing resources and avoiding bankruptcy. The game blends strategic decision-making with light simulation elements to create an engaging and competitive experience.  

- Built with **object-oriented design** principles and a modular structure for flexibility and scalability.  
- Includes **two gameplay modes**:  
  - *Full Mode* – Traditional last-player-standing gameplay.  
  - *Abridged Mode* – Timed 5-minute sessions with the winner determined by total property worth.  
- Features **AI-driven bot players**, **real-time auctions**, and interactive mechanics such as “Opportunity Knocks” and “Potluck” cards.  
- Developed using **Python** and **Pygame**, integrating GUI interactions, turn logic, and data management via spreadsheet input.  
- Future improvements include enhanced animations, save/load functionality, and AI player personality traits.  

*Core Areas:* Python · Game Logic · GUI Design · Artificial Intelligence · Object-Oriented Programming  
*Status:* Completed Prototype

### Civilization Through Crisis  
**Final Year Project – University of Sussex**  

A 3D AI-driven sandbox simulation exploring how human societies evolve and adapt to environmental and geographic challenges across history. The project combines game design, artificial intelligence, and systems thinking to model the dynamics of sustainability, resilience, and civilisation under pressure.  

- Focused on **complex adaptive systems**, **AI agent behaviour**, and **interactive world simulation**.  
- Developed as both an **engaging sandbox experience** and an **educational tool** for exploring socio-ecological feedback loops.  
- Features procedurally evolving environments, emergent societal behaviours, and data-driven evaluation of player decision-making.  

*Core Areas:* Game Development · AI Simulation · Sustainability Systems · Human–Computer Interaction  
*Status:* In Development
